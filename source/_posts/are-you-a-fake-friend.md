Have you ever been betrayed? Have you ever discovered that a friend has been fake to you? Are you a fake friend?

> Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me. (Psalm 41:9)

It’s painful. You let someone get close to you, open up to them, and them bam! Turns out they were just selfishly taking advantage of you. It hurts more than if that person had never been your friend to begin with.

Jesus is no stranger to this pain you might feel. He experienced it at its fullest. One of his disciples, the 12 men who he spent the most time with, betrayed him for 30 pieces of silver. According to Exodus 21:32, this was the price of a slave in that culture.

> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Hebrews 4:15-16)

How will we respond when we experience betrayal or a break of trust? Will we draw near to the throne of grace? Will we respond with grace to the person that offended us, or will we lash out? Our natural inclination is to go on the offense, and get angry with the person. We’re taught from a young age, especially in individualistic American culture, to stand up for ourselves and never let anyone trample us. And yes, to an extent, we aren’t strong enough to let just anybody continually trample us, and there’s a line where it needs to be dealt with. It can even be prideful to press on in this sometimes. But as much as we can, we should show grace to those who wrong us, and when we run out of strength, we then run to the cross, where Jesus was mocked and trampled for our sins.

Which leads me to another point. I’ve been talking mostly about what it’s like to be on the receiving end of betrayal. But just as equally, we are the ones who betray others. Sometimes unknowingly (and often with full knowledge), we use people. We are by nature selfish.

So often we even betray Jesus on a daily basis! It’s always good to ask oneself: are you “friends” with Jesus because of the nice things you believe He can give you, or is it because you love Him and want to spend eternity with Him? Do you still praise God when you are broke, sick, and depressed?

> Well if you love me, then just love me. Don’t you give me pretty words. (Say Your Prayers by The Wedding)

Not only do we experience betrayal and fake friendship, we also betray others, and are often the fake friends ourselves. I’m often very selfish in my relationships. We are sinful creatures, so desperately in need of a Savior. And we have one! Jesus experienced the ultimate betrayal to make up for our many sins, one of which is this deceptive fake “love” we show each other. Let’s run to the throne of grace and fall on our faces before the one who can redeem us. Let’s give our lives to the one who can transform us and fix this sinful nature of ours. Let’s run to Jesus.
