And let’s keep it that way! Because it makes me feel good!

We love being right. I love being right. Sometimes we love holding on to this “being right”, keeping it away from anyone else. When I believe that I have some sort of truth, my natural tendency is to puff up with how awesome I am, instead of lovingly sharing it.

This might sound pretty vague and generic, so let me give you a slightly more solid example. I’ll keep out specifics, though, for the sake of the person involved.

I recently had a problem with something someone in my church was doing. Now, the appropriate & loving thing to do would be to talk to them! Let them know, gently help them out. But what I did was sit and stew about how much better I was than this person. Eventually, this person themselves asked to talk to me, and asked me why I seem to be upset at them. I finally laid things down and explained what was going on. This person then proceeded to give me their explanation. And in the end, it turned out that I had been misunderstanding what this person had been doing. Not only that, but a lot of my judgement had come from my own pride and jealousy! The problem turned out to be me, not the other person!

> Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. (Romans 2:1, ESV)

Reading this passage recently seriously convicted me. Not only had I been wrongfully judging this person, but I was blind to my own sin while I was judging.

I’ve been hearing, reading, and watching a lot lately on some of the silly shenanigans some seeker sensitive churches have been doing. And I still am fully convinced a lot of what they are doing is, in fact, wrong. Spurgeon explains it better than I can.

But what can I do by complaining about it? The solution to a lack of the gospel isn’t complaining about the lack of gospel, it’s preaching the gospel. We get so caught up in pointing out what’s wrong, that we forget to do what is right! Just like I did in my story earlier, it feels really good to point to someone else and talk about how wrong they are. But in doing so, we forget about ourselves. While we are pointing out how unfaithful to the gospel some other church is, how faithful are we to the gospel in our own church?

We all fail at this daily, I do especially. But here’s the beautiful thing about grace: if we put our trust and hope in what Jesus has done for us on the cross, God will continue to transform and sanctify us. We are not perfect, but we are being perfected. Only He can change a sinful heart. Only He can give us the strength we need to fight against our flesh. Only He can open up our eyes to recognize our sinfulness and pride. And finally, only He can save us from the eternal punishment we deserve.

I’d like to make one more final but extremely important note. There’s a good chance that something I said in this blog post is completely wrong. To anyone who is reading this post, I plead that you always keep the word of God above anything else you read. Go to the Bible for your answers before you go anywhere else. If I say one thing and the Bible says something else, always prefer what the Bible says.
