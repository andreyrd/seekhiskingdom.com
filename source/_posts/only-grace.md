These are the lyrics and chords to a song I once wrote. It’s about God’s grace that sets us free and transforms us. I plan on eventually recording a YouTube video to demonstrate the melody, as well as creating a nicely formatted PDF version of the chords.

Verse: | E | B | C#m | A2 |
Chorus: | G#m | C#m | G#m | A2 |
Bridge: | B | A2 |

**Verse 1**  
Without You I am hopeless  
Without You I’m condemned  
Through You I am set free  
Through You I’m redeemed  

**Chorus**  
It’s grace and only grace  
Holy Spirit, change my heart  
Through Your grace and only grace  
Jesus, keep my gaze on You  

**Verse 2**  
Only through the Son we’re saved  
By His precious blood all’s erased  
Daily we die to ourselves  
Through Your Spirit we’re renewed  

**Chorus**  
It’s grace and only grace  
Holy Spirit, change our hearts  
Through Your grace and only grace  
Jesus, keep our gaze on You  

**Bridge**  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  

**Chorus**  
It’s grace and only grace  
Holy Spirit, change our hearts  
Through Your grace and only grace  
Jesus, keep our gaze on you
